- Today, I leased a server offering KVM2 from Hostinger for 24 months. It cost me 194 CAD in total and comes with 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, and 100 GB storage.
- My objectives for buying this server are:
    - To set it up and experiment with Linux, such as configuring firewalls, getting more hands-on with Vim, and trying different Docker images with port mapping to simulate a production server for a clearer understanding of these processes.
    - To deploy some backend APIs that I will use alongside Vercel frontend applications.
- This repository will document all the changes I make on my Linux server for my own reference. I will try to organize and follow a standard structure.
